## Tech stack ðŸ“š
This website built with [Next.js]() as the framework alongside multiple libraries.

### Frontend
- React
- TailwindCSS
- Next.js

### Backend
- Prisma
- PostgreSQL
- Vercel (Docker for local development)

## Deployment
To deploy this web app, you can either use Vercel:

> [![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FRiceCX%2FMeditate&env=POSTGRES_USER,POSTGRES_PASSWORD,POSTGRES_DB,DB_HOST,DB_PORT,DB_SCHEMA&envDescription=Postgres%20authentication)

Or use [Docker]() and [docker-compose]() once you clone the website to your local computer.

If you are using docker, make sure you do `yarn install` in order to install all of the dependencies needed.
Afterwards you are now able to run `yarn docker:db` and `yarn dev` or `yarn build` & `yarn start`.
